__⚠DO NOT GIVE THESE 24 WORDS TO ANYONE__ including us. He who controls the mnemonics, controls the wallet. CelesChia cannot do anything if your wallet is compromised. 

__⚠CREATE SECURE BACKUPS OF THE MNEMONICS RIGHT IMMEDIATELY__. Upload to your Google Drive, save to a flash drive, tattoo them on your butt, etc... CelesChia cannot do anything if you lose access to your wallet.

# Pooling
Farming chia with a pool does __NOT__ increase your chance of winning chia coins. In fact, the pool takes a __0.1%__ (rate may change) cut from the coins you farm. However, pooling does provide a more consistent and reliable output and is therefore strongly recommended by CelesChia. If you do not wish to pool with others and want to farm on your own, you can skip the next few sections. 

Go to [HPool](https://www.hpool.com). In the top right corner, change your language preference and ``Sign Up`` for an account. You will need to verify your email address and phone number.

# Setting Up Withdrawal 

After you have your account set up, follow these steps closely: 
<ol>
<li> Click on your email and then go into Personal Center. </li>
<li> Go to Address under Security </li>
<li> Set your coin type of CHIA </li>
<li> Click Add Address </li>
</ol>

Now go back to your Chia client and copy your ``Receive Address``.

![Alt text](/pic/pool2.png)

Paste that into ``Address:`` on HPool. Hit ``Confirm`` and you should be all set.

At this point, the Chia coins you farm will be withdrawn to your wallet. If you want Bernard to ~~laundry~~ _process_ them for you, ask for his receiving address instead. 

# Register Your Keys with HPool
Welcome to the final steps, you are almost done! 

First to go ``Open Pool`` and open a ``CHIA ECO`` pool.

Ask Bernard for a ``Signature `` and put it in.  

Copy your ``API Key`` and email it to mjin@celeschia.com.
